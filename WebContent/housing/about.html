<h1>About</h1>
<p>
The NESTS application was built IBM Watson Service, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tradeoff-analytics.html">Tradeoff Analytics</a>. 
NESTS allows the user to search for FHA-eligible homes in America, using real-time data.
<p>
It is as simple as picking a state, filtering by criteria such as price, beds, and baths, and then allowing Tradeoff Analytics to help you compare homes to make the best choice.
<p>
What sets NESTS apart from other real estate sites starts from the moment you begin searching. 
The application adds blue flags to homes that may not offer the best value to the user, and provides the user with other selections which present greater while considering multiple criteria. 
It then presents this data using Tradeoff Analytics novel interactive visuals. 
The service exposes tradeoffs between options, and allows the user to compare and explore their options. 
By that, users searching for a home, make a better informed decision.
